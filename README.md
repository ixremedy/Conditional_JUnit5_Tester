# Conditional_JUnit5_Tester
(c) Lev Vanyan, Forthreal

A little framework that enables the user to define a list of dependant tests cases that won't be executed if the parent test cases failed.

I am developing this simple framework on a need to make certain JUnit tests dependent on other tests.

I'll keep improving this till that suits my original purpose :)
